# **__Read Me__**
This is a repository for notes taken while reading the *Intro to Ruby* book that is part of *Launch School*.

It will contain code examples for each chapter in separate directories and another markdown file that contains notes taken.

The exercise of taking notes in Markdown will encourage learning of markdown language as well.
