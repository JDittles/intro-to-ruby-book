# **Variables**
## - *What is a Variable?*
  - Variable are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program
  - Allow for labelling data with a descriptive name
  - Think of them as containers for data
  - *Assigning Value to Variables*
    - Naming is hard
      - Make sure it's *accurately descriptive* and *understandable to other readers*
    - Assign with `=` symbol
      - `first_name = 'joe'`
      - don't confuse assignment `=` with equality operator `==`
    - variables point to values in memory and are not deeply linked to each other
      - for example if we set `a = 4` and then `b = a`, `b` will be 4 even if we reassign `a` a different value
    - *Getting Data from a User*
      - `gets` method
        - this waits for user to 1) type in information and 2) hit the enter key.
        - `.chomp` is useful with `gets` to remove the carriage return characters that are created when the user hits enter
  - *Variable Scope*
    - scope is defined by where the variable is initialized
    - variable scope is defined by a *block*
    - *block* is a piece of code following a method invocation, usually delimited by either curly braces `{}` or `do/end`. (not all `do/end` pairs imply a block)
    - **inner scope can access variables initialized in an outer scope, but not vice versa**
  - *Types of Variables*
    - Five Types: Constants, global variables, class variables, instance variables, and local variables.
    -  Constants
      - `VARIABLE = 'an unchanging value'`
      - declared by capitalizing every letter in  the variable's name, per Ruby convention.
      - store data that never needs to change
      - Ruby allows for the value to change (but throws a warning and shouldn't be done)
      - cannot be declared in method definitions
      - are available throughout your application's scopes
    - Global Variables
      - `$var = 'some value or whatever'`
      - are declared by starting the variable name with the dollar sign (`$`)
      - are available throughout your entire app
      - override all scope boundaries
      - *can cause unexpected complications and are generally avoided*
    - Class Variables
      - `@@variable = 0`
      - declared with two `@`'s
      - accessible by instances of your class as well as the class itself
      - *when you need to delcare a variable that is related to a class, but each  instance of that class does no need its own value for this variable*
      - initialized at the class level, outside of any method definitions
      - can be altered using class or instance method definitions
    - Instance Variables
      - `@var = 'available throughout current instance of class'`
      - declared with one `@`
      - available throughout the current instance of the parent class
      - can cross some scope boundaries but not all of them
    - Local Variables
      - `var = 'I muse be passed around to cross scope boundaries'`
